# Rustwall - Overhaul mod for Vintage Story


## Synopsis
Rustwall is an overhaul mod designed for use on the Mudwall server. 

Conceptually, the goal is to provide some balance between the two different types of Vintage Story server:

- Perpetual, never wiping
  - These servers are characterized by never wiping their maps, always keeping the same world. These worlds suffer from a lack of new content and player burnout as players complete all of their goals and have no reason to continue playing.
- Seasonal, regular wipes 
  - These servers are notable for regularly deleting the world and starting fresh, or perhaps carrying forward some amount of items.

Rustwall bridges the gap by providing both experiences side-by-side, with the following features:
- There is a safe zone at the center of the map, 1km x 1km in size. This area never wipes, and houses special machinery.

I ran out of motivation to finish writing this README so I'll update it later.
